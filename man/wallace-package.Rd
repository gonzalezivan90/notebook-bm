\title{\emph{Wallace}: A modular platform for reproducible ecological modeling}
\description{
\emph{Wallace} is a \code{shiny} app that guides users through a complete
  species niche/distributional modeling analysis, from the acquisition of
  species occurrence and environmental data to visualizing model predictions
  on an interactive map (\code{rleaflet}), thus bundling complex workflows
  into a single, streamlined GUI interface. New functionality, in the form of
   modules, can be added to \emph{Wallace} via contributions from the user
   community. In addition, executable session code (R Markdown format) can
   be downloaded to share with others or use as supplementary information
   for scientific papers and reports. The application is run via the
   function \code{\link{run_wallace}}.
